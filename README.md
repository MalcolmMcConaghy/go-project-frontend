# Go Project Frontend

Job search tracker using Remix and Material UI v5.

npm run dev to start the project

Must be ran with my Go Project to access apis

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Remix](https://remix.run/), which is a full stack web framework.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
